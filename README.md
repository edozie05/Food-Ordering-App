# Food-Ordering-App
My solo project to create a simple food ordering app using HTML, CSS and javaScript

This was an interesting solo project from Scrimba to build a food ordereing app for a restaurant. I was provided with a figma design file which i was supposed to work with its design specifications.
Over the course of this project, i was exposed to a lot of new javaScript concepts and well as ample oppotunities to practice and reinforce the ones i was already familiar with. 
concepts like .map, .forEach, .splice, .filter, .dataset, DOM manipulation, and a host of other javascript functions all came in handy in this project.

i reinforced my aility to make the computer perform more complex tasks by giving simple and precise information as clearly as possible. Overall it was a great learning experience working on this project.
